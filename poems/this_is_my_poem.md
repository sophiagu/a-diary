### This is my poem

```
I'm an old soul,
    a non-conformist,
    and a visionary

Dreaming of a distant future
that no one else might understand.
Loneliness is always with me

But i'm learning to say
    "Goodbye,"
to another day devoured by light
with a smile,
because i know
Sadness is a slow death, and

This is my poem.
