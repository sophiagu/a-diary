### The Inverted Spectrum/Qualia
In a hypothetical scenario, one person sees colors systematically differently from another (for instance, with an exactly inverted spectrum). However, they have matched the colors they see with color vocabulary since birth. So, two people could have inverted color spectra, and yet, we would never know?

<br>But what if we can come up with an objective way to determine whether they have distinct perceptions? One method is to measure distances between different colors.

<br>_(Note that this is not a perfect sphere; instead, when we perceive colors, it's in a distorted space.)_<br>
Within this space, the distances between any chosen color (e.g. red) and all other colors turn out to _uniquely_ define that chosen color. This in turn, implies that inverted qualia is _mathematically impossible_.

#### p.s.
Cones, distributed non-uniformly across the retina, are responsible for color perception. And we primarily have three types of them:

<br>Note that there are almost no S cones in the center of the fovea.
Interestingly, M and L pigments are encoded on the X-chromosome, and L gene in particular exhibits significant variation. This is why females tend to perceive more colors, and some women may even be tetrachromatic.
