### Behind the fluff: the science of white rabbit tails

If you've ever noticed something peculiar about rabbits, you may have wondered why, regardless of their fur color, the bottoms of their tails always appear white. Well, the answer lies in the intriguing aspect of wild rabbit survival strategy while evading predators. Shall we dive deeper?

To begin with, rabbits, being small creatures, can't possibly outrun larger predators. However, nature has bestowed them with agility as their survival tool. This agility translates into their unpredictable movements and sudden changes of direction. It's this unpredictable, swift maneuvering that leads to some comical situations when a rabbit, in its typical hopping rhythm, unexpectedly bumps into a wall or a tree.

Moving on to the second point, when a rabbit is far enough away from its predator, the predator's vision is typically drawn to the extremity of the rabbitâ€™s body, which is its tail! A clever diversion technique rabbits adopt is to swing their tail in the opposite direction when they change their running course. This sudden switcheroo can mislead the predator, causing it to miscalculate the rabbit's actual direction of escape, thereby increasing the rabbit's chances of evading capture.
