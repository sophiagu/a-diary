### This is a Hypothetical Proposal for Fun, but when appropriate, it may also worth serious consideration

To ensure that papers are reviewed and cited based solely on their content, we could introduce an cryptographic system. In this system, each author would be assigned a unique identifier (UID) upon joining a research community.
This UID should be kept confidential, much like a password, known only to the author. The author should not disclose this number unless they decide to permanently exit the community.

For every paper they produce, a new number would be generated randomly and appended to their UID before encryption.
The identity of the original author could only be deciphered and resolved by the central system.
This ensures that correspondences of paper discussions, funding, etc. can still be directed to the appropriate individual.
