### How to Invent Dance Moves?

_**Step 0:**_ Find a roomy spot where collisions with random objects are off the dance card. And be sure the floor has the right degree of friction - one where you can both take flight like a bird and glide like a fish gracefully.

_**Step 1:**_ Close your door and double-check that no one's watching (you're now free to contort your body into whatever odd shapes you fancy!)

_**Step 2:**_ Close your eyes and let your soul meld with the music.

_**Step 3:**_ Now, forget you're a human being and let every limb, every toe, every strand of hair, and, every living cell, groove with the rhythm!
