### Moods in tune with Music

Tuning one's mood isn't quite like adjusting a musical instrument, which usually is fairly fast. Instead, it's a symphony in slow motion.

From what I've found: If I put on some music, it won't instantaneously lift or lower my mood. But let the melodies waft through the air day after day, week after week, and a subtle transformation begins. It's as if the music seeps into my being, gradually finding its way to my brain, where it begins to harmonize with my thoughts.
In the orchestra of emotions, if you find yourself in a minor key, try a bright, upbeat tune. Conversely, if you're riding a crescendo of energy, try some mellower bluesy rhythms.
