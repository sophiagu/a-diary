### The 5-2 weekly calendar may be a poor design

Why has no one ever challenged the status quo of the current calendar system? Working 5 days out of 7 sounds both arbitrary and...excessive?

Put that aside, let's imagine you're running a business from a rented space, shelling out rent every single day. Yet your office turns into a deserted ghost town every weekend...That's a fair chunk of wasted rent!

What if instead we split employees into two groups, with one group working on odd-numbered days and the other on even ones? For simplicity, let's assume a year has 365 days. New Year's Day would invariably fall on an odd date, so to be fair, everyone rests on that day.
Now your business becomes more cost efficient and you can hire more people with the same amount of space. 
And here's the icing on the cake: To nudge Americans into avoiding workaholism, we could divide everyone into three groups. Let's denote them by $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$. Because $365 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, everyone enjoys two common days off: one from the set $1 + 3\mathbb{Z}$ and another from $2 + 3\mathbb{Z}$ -> work-life balance and efficient office use all in one fell swoop!
