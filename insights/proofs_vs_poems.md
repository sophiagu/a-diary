#### Poems:
Understanding a proof often requires me to translate a universally recognized logical process into something that aligns with my internal thinking framework, reading a poem similarly demands me to delve into its regional, historical, and philosophical context so as to make a personal connection. And when a poem is written in another language, it also helps to comprehend the connotations, etymologies, and cultural significances of each word.

#### Proofs:
As a poem may invites multiple interpretation, in many cases, a theorem may be proven through different methods.
However, a method that fails to connect intuitively is like a stone skimming across water without sinking in; it touches the surface but doesn't leave a lasting impact on my mind. This is akin to how I find certain readings of a poem more beautiful than others.
