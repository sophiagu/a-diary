There are many ways to send secret messages, but how do you cleverly hide keys in plain sight within a public ciphertext?

#### Spoiler Alert
In Yun Tianming's fairy tales, designed to communicate with humanity while being watched, the hidden messages are unlocked through metaphors.
Tianming's genius lies in his use of nested metaphors, requiring the text to be decoded twice to uncover the real message.

Take, for example, his reference to "Hellsegga Mosken" in these tales. At first glance, it translates to "Norway", a realization many readers come to. However, there's more to it.

Observe that "Norway" splits into "Nor" and "way".
And in chemistry, "Nor" is a prefix for compounds derived from their parents, like "Norpinic acid" and "Norepinephrine".
To understand "way", one must recognize its phonetic similarity to the Mandarin "wei", which translates to "dimensions" in English.

Put together, Tianming's key message is this: humanity's hope lies in avoiding the imminent danger of being relegated to a lower-dimensional existence.
