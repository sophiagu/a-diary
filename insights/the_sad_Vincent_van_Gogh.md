There are many mysteries surrounding Vincent van Gogh, including whether he really committed suicide and whether he was the one who cut off his own ear.

Through his sunflower paintings, where the vibrant yellow hues not only embody the essence of light but also illustrate the sunflowers' relentless quest for sunlight — a poignant metaphor for vitality as seen through Van Gogh's eyes — I sense his profound yearning for life.
However, it is very saddening for me to read about his life stories and appreciate his paintings. This includes the Starry Night, which initially appeared to me as less sorrowful compared to many of his other works.

That said, it is best to understand his personal thoughts through his own writings and correspondences.
