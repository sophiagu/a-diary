### Diffusion Struggles with the Simplest Image Editing Task

I happened to use diffusion to replace the background of my bunny's photo with a flawlessly white backdrop. But diffusion always had to introduce unwanted elements such as scratched white walls or shadows. It even altered my bunny's appearance and added unnecessary decorations...After I tried explicitly stated in my instructions to eliminate all shadows and miscellaneous elements, I continued receiving similar results, never succeeded in getting a true white background in the end ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I wonder whether these T2I models genuinely understand language?
