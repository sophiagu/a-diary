### Old but interesting vision papers

Have you ever had a moment where you conceived a project idea and nurtured it for a while, only to discover after initiating a literature review that someone else had already explored something remarkably similar? That your once seemingly "novel" idea had been mirrored in a project conducted years before you even embarked on your research journey?

Here are some scattered papers from the past:

_Dynamic Filter Networks, Brabandere et al. 2016:_

> A dynamic convolutional layer is similar to a traditional convolutional layer in that the same filter is applied at every position of the input _I<sub>B</sub>_ . But different from the traditional convolutional layer where filter weights are model parameters, in a dynamic convolutional layer the filter parameters are dynamically generated by a filter-generating network.
>
> If the generated filters are again constrained with a softmax function so that each filter only contains one non-zero element, then the dynamic local filtering layer replaces each element of the input _I<sub>B</sub>_ by an element selected from a local neighbourhood around it. This offers a natural way to model local spatial deformations conditioned on another input _I<sub>A</sub>_.
