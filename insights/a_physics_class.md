### A physics class that I remember till today

My physics teacher once drew a large sun on the whiteboard and asked me to draw the Earth. I proceeded to draw a small Earth, placing it some distance away from the Sun on the same whiteboard.

At first glance, it seemed a trivial task.
However, the trickiness lies in the fact that, given the actual relative sizes and distances, it would be impossible to place the Earth on the same board with the Sun albeit it was a long board.
Indeed, nearly all images of the solar system we see online are not accurate, as they don't correctly respect the relative measures of celestial bodies.
