### How Does It Feel to Be Multilingual?

Being multilingual, I’ve come to understand how each language, with its rich history of experiences, knowledge, and culture, profoundly shapes my way of thinking.

If you’re monolingual (this includes primarily thinking and using just one language) and are curious about this question:
> Does switching languages merely alter the final form of my thoughts?

My answer is negative. Indeed, the transformation begins at the onset of the thought process, affecting deep-seated philosophies and even personalities, before being articulated in a specific language. This, to me, is the magical effect of languages on our minds.

That being said, language comes in many forms. Take math for example. It's a simple and elegant universal language understood by many across different regions and cultures, and thus acts as an effective bridge between people. For instance, when I travel to foreign places and meet people with unfamiliar conventions and social etiquettes, it can sometimes be a bit intimidating initially. However, as soon as we start talking about math, I feel at home and any fear quickly dissipates.
