### Generative AI x Art x Creativity

While AI continues to refine its ability to "interpolate" or link together existing knowledge, there's no empirical evidence to suggest it's capable of "extrapolation"—reaching beyond the known into the realm of the unprecedented.

For instance, in generative models such as _DALL-E [1]_, AI can whip up what seems to be "original" art, but let's pull back the curtain: The images it generates are based on human-crafted text. In this process, the AI is merely a middleman, translating our text into images based on a weighted combination of the existing data from which it has been trained on. It's like a creative blender, combining pre-stored art or text concepts into a seemingly fresh smoothie, but the ingredients aren't new.

What if we compare AI to human artists' creation processes throughout history? Take Picasso and Braque's development of _Cubism [2]_ for example: This began with both artists challenging the conventional notions of "realistic" art. Then, inspired by African art and combined with their own unique styles and innovations (such as Picasso's introduction of "collage" in his work "Still Life with Chair Caning" and Braque's use of "papier collé" in his piece "Fruit Dish and Glass"), they engaged in extensive experimentation with ideas such as pasting colored and printed pieces of paper onto paintings, which eventually led to the birth of Cubism. Therefore, both personal ideas and experimentation are critical components of creativity that current AI systems can't achieve solely by interpolating existing data.

On _Vision, Language, and Creativity_, the panelist Irani also touched upon an intriguing point about the difference between humans and machines. Humans, after a few examples, can start "creating" art, while machines need a plethora of data to learn. This disparity, she suggested, is due to humans possessing an artistic "prior".

I understand the exact reason for this disparity existing between humans and current AI models. Consequently, I also know how to modify the models to enable AI to learn with as little data as humans do. However, I believe I can't disclose it to anyone, for it would be too powerful.
