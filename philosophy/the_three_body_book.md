#### To elaborate:

For the majority, research is deemed as a job. Thus, it's logical to pursue "normal" research that builds upon previous works with minor adjustments, without making qualitative changes or challenging the prevailing thinking.

> To me, research is more like a bean bag, into which I can poke a hole and sink as deep as I wish. However, it's crucial to emerge regularly, as sitting there for too long can be detrimental.

But for another set of people, our interests mainly lie in finding truths, discovering the unknown, and explaining the unexplainable — sometimes it may demand unwavering pursuits.
However, when one ventures into this realm and more so towards theoretical constructions, it often results in mental turmoil because we frequently encounter things that are not fully grounded in "absolute truths". When we reach the boundaries of science, we may challenge the old conjectures or come up with new hypotheses that may be correct, but at the same time, they may also be incorrect. Often the only thing we can rely on is empirical evidence; however, empirical evidence may or may not be self-consistent, and unlike proofs, such evidence alone is often insufficient to dispel our doubts when venturing into uncharted territory. A similar struggle is depicted fictionally in the book when physicists observe phenomena that seem contradictory to established laws and theories, leading them to question their own research and life.

#### Throughout the history, many evolutionary discoveries were initiated from imaginations and/or hypotheses:
- The discovery of the ring structure of the benzene molecule was initially inspired by Kekulé's dream. However, before the advent of X-ray crystallography, there was no direct scientific proof of the ring structure that is commonly present in organic molecules.

- Electromagnetism, before establishing its own domain much later, encountered significant resistance because it appeared to contradict Newtonian physics. A similar story applies to a major scientific movement in the early 1900s, which eventually led to special relativity.

- The discovery and development of complex numbers also faced considerable skepticism (they were first initiated in the 16th century, but it was only until the 19th century that complex numbers had finally found a solid footing in mathematics). Even their creators referred to these numbers as "mental tortures", as opposed to real numbers, their "reality" couldn't be understood or accepted—hence the term "imaginary".

Consequently, much of the scientific knowledge we acknowledge today (but it's possible that upon waking tomorrow, you may realize that everything we've built up so far is incorrect) might bear traces of someone's, or perhaps a few generations', prolonged questioning and profound anguish.
