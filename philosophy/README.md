### Love (philos) + Wisdom (sophos) = Philosophy

_Truth might only be found through continuous exploration and correction, as well as through greater realizations. It is something I can approach asymptotically, but never truly reach._

#### A list of perhaps weird things

- It is $0$ at $\infty$, and it is $\infty$ at $0$.

- The world is circular, so don't worry and take it easy.

- I'm always seemingly one step behind myself. For every problem I find a solution for, I inevitably uncover new ones to tackle.

- The beautiful [Mandelbrot set](https://youtu.be/pCpLWbHVNhk)

- From the Mandelbrot set to creating [audio sounds](https://youtu.be/GiAj9WW1OfQ?t=137)

- In my dream, I encountered an intricate geometric maze that despite its finite appearance, offered an infinite exploration without ever retracing my steps; yet it was not a fractal.

- Somewhat related to fractals, a fun "[proof](https://youtu.be/D2xYjiL8yyE?si=8NUbgr3CfpoBti57)" of $\pi=2$ using infinite zigzags.

- Every chance occurrence might be deterministic, and every determinism unravels by chance. The world might have begun as an amorphous cloud of uncertainty, but through an infinite array of random observations and expressions of will, these numerous uncertain universes had to collapse, ultimately coalescing into a singular, more defined entity.

- Science, while seeking to rationalize the mysteries of natural phenomena, is paradoxically founded on axioms and principles that remain, at their core, inexplicable.

- At a microscopic level, everything is fundamentally probabilistic, making certainty seem more like an illusion in the larger, macroscopic realm.

If you imagine a spectrum, stretching from the micro to the macro level, with our everyday experiences sitting in the middle, then the physics we learn primarily comprises sets of formulas that encapsulate the common patterns we observe within this comfortable range. However, as one walks away from this familiar zone and towards the two extreme ends of this spectrum, one encounters phenomena that become increasingly peculiar.

This example showcases a problem in underdeveloped science, where understanding of the world is limited by one's immediate living environment, experiences, and personal senses (indeed, everyone's senses are slightly different, resulting in our nuanced perceptions of the world). In turn, lessons formed within these confines might prove to be less comprehensive compared to those derived from observing the grander universe.

- TFW you _think_ you've figured out the rules for playing the game of life but not the reasons behind them, so you hypothesize numerous plausible models only to start seeing illusions:
