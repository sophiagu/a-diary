### Why am I into abstract forms of art?

One compelling reason for my attraction to music and art lies in their ability to transcend interpersonal boundaries. Often, the more profound the emotion, the more challenging it is to articulate it through plain language. This, to me, is the enchantment of some of the world's greatest art.

Take, for instance, my encounter with Julie Mehretu's "HOWL, eon (I, II)". Though I've not personally witnessed major social upheavals, my own experiences of profound sorrow, despair, and a sense of annihilation found a powerful echo in Mehretu's equally tumultuous and intense portrayal of colonization, which almost bordered on a feeling of illness.
The instant my eyes beheld those struggling and turbulent brushes of curves intertwined over distorted digital landscapes, I, too, howled.

To me, these strong emotions, as nebulous as they are, are most potently expressed through abstract shapes, which also allow me to genuinely connect with the artist.
I'm not sure if I am supposed to appreciate other types of art, such as those depicting beautiful sceneries and creatures with fine details and vibrant colors. Sometimes, I find myself enjoying them too.

I could spend an entire day sitting in a gallery, allowing profound, endless, and cadenced thoughts to wash over my mind in waves. I thought of Van Gogh once, and his journey toward becoming a priest. To me, he _WAS_ a priest; he was willing to give up everything he had, much like when he lived among the coal miners in Belgium. I think priests are not defined by their attire, dining manners, or expertise in Latin, but by qualities like those of Van Gogh.
