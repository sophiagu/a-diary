When two particles become entangled, their states become interdependent, no matter the distance between them. If we measure one particle and determine its state, the state of the other particle is instantly known, even if they're galaxies apart. This has led to Einstein's famous remark calling it "spooky action at a distance" as it appears to defy the speed limit set by light.

Another intriguing aspect of quantum entanglement concerns its potential role in brain and consciousness. Over the years, several researchers have speculated that the brain might exploit quantum entanglement in its operations, and that this could be related to consciousness. In particular, physicist Roger Penrose and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff have proposed a theory suggesting that quantum effects in microtubules within neurons contribute to consciousness. Currently, this theory remains unproven; and several experiments have also suggested its implausibility _[1]_.
