### My questioning of some Psychology research

In 1990, psychologists Langlois and Roggman found, _surprisingly_, that the composite face was deemed the most visually attractive of all the faces.<br>
This psychological research gives me pause...If one were to actually view the computer-generated composite face, I bet hardly anyone would consider it the most beautiful face they've ever seen or imagined.<br>
This is one of those moments when statistical measurements provide _the_ answer one seeks, which in this case it is the average (this answer is also quite predictable by quantitative formulas). Yet in reality this "answer" almost never hold true for any individual case.<br>
Isn't that ridiculous?

### Doctrine of the Mean

This is part of _Confucianism_, and this particular teaching advocates for a balanced, harmonious way of life that avoids extremes.
There are many interpretations of Doctrine of the Mean, such as the idea that to live a happy life, one has to strive to be an "average" person. But why is that? Does being an "average" person really make one happy?

Here is my way of understanding it:<br>
Let's imagine the particular aspects of humans that we are interested in as data points on a diagram, and mark the average as the center of this diagram.
The assumption here is that, as long as we live in a society that requires us to interact with others, it makes sense that the closer we are to another person, the more likely we will have similar perspectives and the more rapport we will feel with that person.
Now suppose I'm one of those individuals at the extremes and live on the far east of this diagram. Then I would have a more difficult time interacting with someone living on the far west compared to if I were to live in the middle. Moreover, my net sum of distances to all the other people would be much larger than if I were an "average".

The idea therefore makes sense, yet it's not without flaws: Would I truly be happy if I had to become a huge alien to my original self?
