### Gravitational “Life” Force

One question persistently plagues my thoughts: What truly distinguishes life from death? I've encountered tales of the elderly, on the precipice of passing, intuiting their imminent departure. This foresight beckons my curiosity: through which inherent senses or understanding does one foresee their approaching “end”?

In a recent dream, I felt my soul suddenly become so “light” that it was about to fly off, a profound feeling very likely related to the elderly’s tales. I term this detachment (or attachment) of my soul to "this world" the _gravitational “life” force_. This force wasn’t merely a connection; it was akin to the gravitational pull that binds physical objects with mass to the Earth. Yet, in this context, I surmise my soul lacks tangible mass, and its nature extends beyond mere physicality, reaching realms beyond which our standard senses can comprehend.

The mysteries of this “life” force remain mostly elusive to mainstream science. However, if I could liken it to a gravitational pull, I wonder if my soul, once released from its current binding to “this world”, would wander in the cosmic expanse and potentially gravitate towards another realm or “world”, similar to celestial bodies in space but on a metaphysical plane?

With some minor differences, Plato's metaphysical reflections resonate deeply with my personal inquiries. He theorized that our souls exist in a realm of ideal forms, a space distinct from our tangible world, before taking shape in a physical body. In its pure form, the eternal soul engages directly with immutable ideas and forms, seeking understanding and wisdom before its descent into the corporeal realm. Further, the concept of “life” force, often described as an intangible essence in living entities, draws parallels with several Eastern teachings that suggest a vital energy or force that binds and sustains the entirety of existence.
