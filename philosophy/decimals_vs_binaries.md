<i>Question</i>: Why is the decimal system so ingrained in humans, while machines default to binary?

<i>Short answer</i>: Our numbering system emerged from counting using our fingers - ten in total. Machines, however, lack fingers. Therefore, despite the advancements in AI, we remain fundamentally different species - measured by the number of fingers.

<i>Slightly longer answer</i>: Now you might ask, "Why not base-20, considering we also have toes?" In fact, base-20 was quite prevalent in the past.

<i>Weird knowledge that only bunny owners know</i>: Do you know how many toes rabbits have? Could this toe tally determine our common creature-ship?
