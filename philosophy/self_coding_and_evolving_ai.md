### Will AI start coding and evolving itself one day?

[GitHub CEO says Copilot will write 80% of code “sooner than later”](https://globenewsbulletin.com/technology/github-ceo-says-copilot-will-write-80-of-code-sooner-than-later/)
-> a question that immediately springs to my mind is, "which 80%?"
I'm not specifically targeting Copilot here. I acknowledge that there's an array of apps, plugins, and many open-source tools already capable of generating high-quality code. The future, it seems, is already upon us.

However, my more significant concern centers around the implications of AI writing and evolving its code by itself. Imagine a future where human developers become unnecessary for AI evolution; where AI independently determines its objectives, self-edits its programs, and refines and updates its abilities online.

What would our role be in such a world? Are we relegated to passive consumers of AI-provided services, spending our days browsing AI-curated content? Will our brain be shaped by AI-driven courses, and learn new languages the way that an AI speaks or "wants" us to speak?
