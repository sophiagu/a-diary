### Thought experiment of an individual's choice of action in a given social situation

#### Setup:
- **The chessboard:** an existing social web
- **White chess piece (Y):** our test subject, initially assumed to be "neutral", meaning it doesn't carry any innate personality traits
- **Black chess pieces (X):** other individuals
- **Y's position on the board:** Y's designated roles and responsibilities within the web
- **Arrows:** actions from the black pieces directed towards Y that are beyond Y's control

- Next we relax our assumption of Y being entirely neutral by introducing **a perpendicular plane to the chessboard**: invisible personal data, like history, health, and family relationships, that shapes Y's decision making or behavior

#### Question:
Is Y's behavior truly free, or is it deterministic and thus predictable?
