### From my childhood to lost dreams

When I was a kid, my expectations of life were simple: I wanted to play every game I loved, and I hoped to live long enough to await the release of my anticipated games and enjoy them to completion.<br>
Back when those games were stored on cards, I practiced fire drills, ensuring that in emergencies I could escape with my treasured games, as they held a value equivalent to my very life.

Now that I've grown up, I yearn for games with intricate mechanisms, thoughtfully-designed worlds, and deeply woven narratives comparable to finely penned novels.
However, the gaming market seems to have shifted in a different direction. Particularly, AAA games have increasingly become mere eye candies or ear candies - these elements should be meant to serve the game world and story - lacking the depth and substance that games should primarily possess to be truly enjoyable. Many games also employ psychological ploys to retain players without genuinely offering a fun or enriching experience.

These games are no longer the treasures I once would have protected with my life. They become a far cry from the dreams of my childhood.
